### 🧠 MINI PROJECT: **Guess the Number!** 🎯

> "WOOHOO... CORRECT NUMBER!!! 🎉" — That's what you'll hear (well, see) when you finally crack the mystery number! 😄

### 📌 About This Project

This is a **Java-based console game** where the computer generates a random number between `1 and 100`, and your task is to **guess it**. The game gives feedback on whether your guess is **too high** or **too low**, and continues until you nail it.

It’s simple. It’s fun. It’s addictive. 🤩

### 🕹️ How it Works

* The computer picks a random number: `myNumber = (int)(Math.random()*100)`
* You enter your guess using a `Scanner`
* The game gives you hints like:

  * “Your number is too small” 📉
  * “Your number is too big” 📈
* When you guess it right:

  * **“WOOHOO .. CORRECT NUMBER!!!”** 🎊

### 🎯 Example Output

```
Guess my number (1–100):
Your number is too small
Guess my number (1–100):
WOOHOO .. CORRECT NUMBER!!!
My number was: 84
Process finished with exit code 0
```
